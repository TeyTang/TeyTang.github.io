            <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Hi, thanks for visiting my portfolio. Let me tell you about myself.
I am a US citizen, Montagnard American to be exact. My family came here as refugees when I was
     8 and soon we all became US Citizens. I grew up in Greensboro, NC, USA. Here, I graduated 
     from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro with a bachelor's degree in computer science. 
     Growing up, I have always been fascinated by technology. I knew that one day I want a 
     job in tech. I spent years teaching myself various tech skills, that include web development, software 
     development, back-end development, app development, ladder logic, or microcontrollers/robotics. 
     In my latest tech job as an app developer for a small startup, I work with technologies such as Flutter and 
     help maintain existing apps in native languages such as Swift and Kotlin. Now I spend most of my 
     time learning and developing mobile games and creating app tutorials, such as developing apps with 
     Java in Android Studio. I also have experience making websites using a combination of PHP, HTML, and MySQL.
